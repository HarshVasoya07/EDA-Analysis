<h1>EDA Analysis feature vs display</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
The provided code performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset using libraries such as seaborn, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.pyplot. It addresses questions regarding the impact of displaying and featuring products on demand, the influence of the number of unique manufacturers on sales, and the relationship between price and sales. The code suggests that both displaying and featuring products can increase sales, without conclusive evidence favoring one over the other. It also indicates that the number of unique manufacturers does not significantly impact sales, as factors like price and customer preferences play a more significant role. The code further explores the hypothesis that lower prices generally lead to higher sales, with exceptions such as high-priced pizza boxes or certain frozen food products. Overall, the code provides insights into the relationship between various factors and sales based on EDA.
